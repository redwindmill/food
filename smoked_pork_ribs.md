- 1 TBSP Garlic powder

**Other**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Prep**
- Trim hanging fat and meat
- Score membrane instead of removing
- 2 heaping TBSPs of pork lard per rib in a metal pan
- Apply the rub
- Let sit for an hour or two. I apply the night before

**Smoking**
- Smoke at 225F for 4 hours; membrane down
- Smoke at 275F for 1 hour
- Add metal pan full of lard to the smoker for the whole time
- At 3 hour mark start spraying ribs with vinegar mix every 15min

**Cooking**
- Apply smoked lard and wrap (butcher paper); meat side down
- Make sure to spray vinegar for the 'steam'
- 30min-45min (meat pin should feel like butter). May take 45-60min

**Glaze (optional)
- Mix vinegar with BBQ sauce to make it easier to apply
- Smoker until it gets sticky
