--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOLDEN RULE: 1/3 salts, 1/3 sugars and 1/3 fragrant spices

**Meat**
- 8lbs pork butt

**Rub**
- 6tbsp brown sugar

**Other**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Prep**
- Score the fat on the top of the pork butt (cross hatch)
- Coat butt in yellow mustard and pickle juice (50/50 mixture)
- Apply rub in a healthy amount
- Let sit for a hour or two. I typically apply the night before

**Smoking**
- Put out on smoker at smoking temp (180-200F)  for 3 hours untouched
- Raise temp to 275-300F (fast) 225-250 (slow) util internal temp is 165-170F
- Apply apple cider vinegar every 30min until smoke phase complete

**Cooking**
- Before wrapping pour some honey and butter on the top of the butt
- After an internal temp around 170f, wrap in butcher paper (fold in a way that fat does not leak out of edges)
- Put back into smoker (300-325F), wait for internal temp around 195-200f. Should feel smooth with poking with probe

**Resting**
- Rest for 1 hour in a cooler
