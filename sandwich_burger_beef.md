## CLASSIC BURGER PATTY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Ingredients**
- 1 lb ground beef (ground chuck 80/20)
- High heat oil or bacon fat
- 1 egg yolk
- Onion slices
- Salt and pepper
- Cheddar Cheese

**Making Patties**
- Mix meat with yolk (oil hands a little to keep from sticking)
- Form into patties, make a depressed ring on one side (picture a volcano)
- Season the volcano side liberally with salt
- Add pepper to the volcano side to taste

**Cooking the patty (side 1)**
- Heat up fat or high heat oil (400-450, butter should burn)
- Place flat side down first with an onion ring on top.
- Flip when lower half is dark crispy brown. (leave the burger alone)

**Cooking the patty (side 2)**
- When flipping the patty, flip the onion with the patty.
- Poke at the patty, if it is soft, let it cook (should be firm)

**Adding Cheese**
- Once a little firm, add cheese to top.
- Remove once somewhat melted (it will continue to cook outside of the pan)

**The Bun**
- Just toast it on the cut side
- Suggested type would be potato buns
